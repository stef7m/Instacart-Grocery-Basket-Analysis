## Tools
For this project, the following tools were used:
- pandas - for data analysis
- matplotlib - for visualisations
- seaborn - for visualisations

## Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Even though they already have very good sales, they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of around 3.4m orders and 206k users and their data in order to derive insights on sales patterns, customer profiles and brand loyalty habits amongst others. Objective was to suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day (i.e., the days and times with the most orders)?
- Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
- To create groupings of the product range based on price tags and analyse ordering habits based on value
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? 
- Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

## Dataset
The dataset comprise information on the following parameters:
- orders
- products
- departments
